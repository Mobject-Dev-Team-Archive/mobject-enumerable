## The mobject-enumerable Library

This is one of the many libraries of mobject. This lightweight library focuses on the common interfaces and functionality of iterators, enumerators and enumerable objects.

## What is mobject?

Pronounced mob-ject.

A sprinkling of OOP is usually enough to simplify and unclutter procedural code. However, the more you apply OOP, the more you find the need to expand it's scope to accommodate functionality which is missing from the language. Hence, mobject was conceived. It's a framework, library and mindset of how problems such as this can be resolved using both pre-written code and examples.

mobject's goal is to be a lightweight solution to typical oop problems.

## Why use mobject-enumerable?

The mobject-enumerable library provides a consistent way to handle iteration and enumeration of elements in an industrial control system. It includes an interface, I_ForwardEnumerator, that can be implemented by classes that need to provide iteration capabilities for their collections or sequences.

The I_ForwardEnumerator interface provides a common interface for objects that need to be enumerable, allowing them to expose a standardized way to traverse their elements. This makes it easy to manage iteration over collections or sequences in a complex system, regardless of their underlying data structure.

Overall, the mobject-enumerable library helps to improve the flexibility and maintainability of industrial control systems by providing a consistent way to handle enumeration and iteration of elements. By enabling developers to work with different data structures using a uniform interface, mobject-enumerable simplifies the development process and reduces the likelihood of programming errors.
